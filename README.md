This repository contains a link to our final web application, and a PDF with our final report which explains the details of our process and project more in-depth. I have also included the data file we used from Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dk123891/10000-movies-data?select=data.csv), and a zipped folder containing the data's licensing and readme file.

## Project Title

**Movie Database**

## Description 

Our movie database explores information about the top 10,000 movies on IMDB. Due to issues with APEX ORACLE's data capacity, we focused on movies between 2018 and 2022. Please see the final report PDF for our Data Dictionary, Entity Relationship Diagram, Relational Schema, SQL Create Table Commands, 5 SQL queries, as well as our process of cleaning the data and creating the web application.

## Additional Documentation

Please note that on Question 2 there is a bug in our SQL query. Our goal was to use a compound SQL query to show us which actors or actresses have acted in the most action and drama movies along with the total of these movies that they have acted in. Instead, it returns the individual totals for each genre which results in some of the actors being listed twice.
